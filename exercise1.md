### I am assuming my backend is written in Go

- For **Linting** I would use **golangci-lint** as its pretty common between go developer
- For testing go's **testing package** would be enough as a starting point
- For building go's **go build** command would be useful

- Other than Jenkins and Github Action there are several cloud alternatives like **harness** and **CirclCI**
- If the testing cycle is not resource intensive I'd stick with cloud base alternative
